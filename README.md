# My Notes

Unfortunately I didn't had much time to properly clean up the code, since I need to finish it today(20.04).
It is because I already have one offer, and I need to give my answer tomorrow (21.04).
But I really liked your project, and would like  to work on ot, so I tried my best.

Also I didn't finished part with saving redux store state. I planned to do it  with redux-persist. Maybe I will do it in the morning.
Thank you.
